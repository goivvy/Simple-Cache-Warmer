Simple Cache Warmer User Guide


Simple Cache Warmer fetches all active CMS, product and category pages to warm Full Page Cache.


After installation go to Stores > Configuration > Goivvy LLC > Simple Cache Warmer to configure the extension.


You will see two options:


1. Enable Cache Warmer - turn it on or keep it off. You can turn on the cache warmer for a single store by changing the Scope dropdown at the top left corner.
2. Warming Frequency - how often the warmer will warm the Full Page Cache. The warmer waits 3 seconds before each page request to not overload a site.

The extension depends on the correct work of a cron process. Make sure you set up cron on a server.


If you have any questions or need a new feature - let a [Magento 2 developer](https://www.goivvy.com) know.
